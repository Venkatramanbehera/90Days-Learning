The Life of a Web Request

The Network Flow: When you query a GenAI app, the journey is massive:
    1. DNS: Translates app.com to an IP.
    2. TCP: Ensures the data arrives intact (Reliability).
    3. TLS: Encrypts the payload so hackers see garbage.
    4. Load Balancer: Receives traffic in the Public Subnet.
    5. Application: Processes logic in the Private Subnet (Air-gapped).
    6. NAT Gateway: Allows the private app to "dial out" to OpenAI/Bedrock without exposing itself to incoming attacks.
