chmod 777 is not a bug fix; it’s a security breach.

Notes:
    📌 The Math of Permissions Linux permissions are just simple addition:
        1. Read (4) + Write (2) + Execute (1) = 7
        2. So, 777 literally means "Anyone in the world can read, write, and execute this file."
        3. Architect's Rule: Never use 777 to "fix" a permission error. You are effectively removing the lock from your front door.

    📌 The AWS "Key" Rule If you try to SSH into an EC2 instance with a key file (.pem) set to 777, AWS will reject the connection immediately.
        1. The Fix: chmod 400 key.pem
        2. The Logic: Only the Owner (4) gets Read access. The Group (0) and Public (0) get nothing.

    📌 GenAI Security: Protecting the Weights In a RAG architecture, your AI Model Weights (like Llama-3-70b.gguf) are your intellectual property.
        1. Leaving them as 755 (Public Read) allows any compromised process on the server to steal the model.
        2. They should be locked down to the specific user running the inference process.
