Public vs. Private Subnets.

architected the network topology that keeps data safe.

Notes: 
    📌 The Front Yard vs. The Bedroom
        - Public Subnet: Has an Internet Gateway. Use this for Load Balancers and Bastion Hosts.
        - Private Subnet: Air-gapped from the internet. Use this for Databases and App Logic.

    📌 The NAT Gateway Bridge If a server is in a Private Subnet (Safe), how does it download updates or call APIs?
        - The Solution: A NAT Gateway sits in the Public Subnet.
        - The Flow: It acts as a one-way valve. Private servers can send requests out (Egress) to the internet, but the internet cannot initiate connections in (Ingress).

    📌 GenAI Application
        - Vector Database: Always goes in the Private Subnet.
        - LLM Calls: If calling OpenAI, the private backend routes through the NAT. If calling AWS Bedrock, we can skip the NAT and use internal VPC Endpoints for better security.
