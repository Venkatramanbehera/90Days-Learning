Networking Notes: The Foundation of Cloud Architecture ☁️

Revisiting core networking concepts. Before building complex distributed systems, the transport layer needs to be solid.

My Key Notes:
1. Packets & Headers
 -> Data moves in envelopes (packets).
 -> The Header steers the traffic.
 -> Cloud Application: Firewalls filter traffic based on header information, not the content inside.
2. IP Addressing
 -> IPv4: Limited, legacy standard.
 -> IPv6: The future standard (hexadecimal), essential for massive scale.
3. Security through Addressing
 -> Public IP: Exposed to the internet (Load Balancers, Web Servers).
 -> Private IP: Internal only (Databases, Backend Logic).
 -> Rule: Never expose a Database via a Public IP.
