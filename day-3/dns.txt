DNS is more than just buying a domain name.

Tackled the Domain Name System (DNS), specifically how we map traffic to infrastructure.

It’s easy to think of DNS as just a URL bar feature, but in Cloud Architecture, it's a routing tool.

Notes:
📌 The "A" Record vs. "CNAME"
    - A Record: Points a name directly to an IP address (192.168.x.x).
    - CNAME: Points a name to another name (Alias). This is crucial when your underlying resources (like Load Balancers) change IPs dynamically.

📌 The AWS "Alias" Superpower In standard DNS, you can't use a CNAME on a root domain (like company.com).
    - The AWS Fix: Route 53 offers "Alias Records."
    - Why it matters: It allows you to map a root domain directly to an AWS Load Balancer or S3 bucket, which standard DNS doesn't support. It also resolves faster than a CNAME.
